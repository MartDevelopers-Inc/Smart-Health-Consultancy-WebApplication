## About Smart Health Consultancy 

It might have happened so many times that you or someone else need doctors help immediately, 
but they are not available due to some reason. The Smart Health Consultation application is an end user
support and online consultation system. This application allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues.
The application allows user to share their symptoms and issues with a doctor of their choice depending on the nature of the ailment. The doctor then checks  the user’s symptoms to check for various illness that could be associated with it.
Then the doctor advices the patient on what medicine to take or if they need to go for further testing.
